    <h1>Inflation is crushing low income groups hope of buying a car</h1>
<p>As the country experiences the effects of rapid inflation, and the increase of interest rates for borrowing costs to counter it, low-income individuals are finding it extremely hard if not impossible to buy cars. For those who can afford it, it often means cutting spending on everyday necessities that are already affected by inflation. And for those who canâ€™t, it could mean missing out on a better job or cheaper grocery stores that require a car to get to.
  Wages increase too since the COVID-19 pandemic, but not enough to make up for the rasing prices. Since 2014, household wages increased 13 percent until 2021. Used cars prices increased by 44 percent in the same time. Since people prioritize expenses like rent, food and transportation, low income groups tend to cut expenses on other categories. This leaves them with almost no income left to afford a car.
